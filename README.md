## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

- The Anaconda distribution of Python.  
- XGBoost. See [here](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html) for installation guide.
- The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation and Overview<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, I was interested in using a Home-Sale-Price dataset from Kaggle Competition to predict future sale price. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to document data cleaning, data preprocessing, models training and selections.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://tba).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Credits are due to Kaggle for the dataset. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).  Otherwise, feel free to use anything here as you would like!
