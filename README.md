# Home Price Prediction.
This repository documents a data science project. In the project, we analyze and model a [Home-Sale-Price dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) to predict sale price.

## Project Overview<a name="motivation"></a>
The goal of this project is to build a regression model that predicts house sale price. 

We performed extensive EDA and Feature Engineering, customized data preprocessing for different models.

We trained three models: logistic regression, SVM, XGBoost Regressor. 

## To-do list <a name="to-do"></a>

We need to improve the exposition of the notebooks.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to document data cleaning, data preprocessing, models training and selections.

## Environment <a name="environment"></a>

- The Anaconda distribution of Python.  
- XGBoost. See [here](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html) for installation guide.
- The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Licensing and Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

The dataset was found on Kaggle and was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. 
You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).
